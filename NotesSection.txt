<p class ="p">1. Photosythetic photon flux (PPF) is a photon-weighted measure of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) which assumes equal weighting for electromagentic radiation between 400 and 700 nanometers (nm). PPF is calculated by multiplying the tested luminaire SPD by the photon-weighted ideal PPF action spectrum and summing the total. It is analogous to luminaire lumens.</p>
<p class ="p">2. PPF is typically calculated in quantum units (&#181;mol/sec), rather than units of radiant power. </p>
<p class ="p">3. PPF%%: The percentage of the measured SPD in the PAR range (400 - 700 nm). </p>
<p class ="p">4. Yield photon flux (YPF) is a photon-weighted measure of PAR which weights electromagentic radiation between 400 and 700 nm according to McCree's (1972a) relative quantum efficiency (RQE) action spectrum. YPF is calculated by multiplying the tested luminaire SPD by the photon-weighted YPF action spectrum and summing the total.</p>
<p class ="p">5. Phytochrome photostationary state (PSS) is a measure of the SPD's impact on phytochrome, a photoreversible plant protein which regulates photomorphogenic responses, seed germination, flowering, and photosynthesis (Sager 1988).PSS is calculated by multiplying the SPD by the ratio of Pr /(Pr+ Pfr) at each wavelength and summing the total. A higher value indicates that the SPD will stimulate more of the red form of phytochrome (Pr) than the far-red form (Pfr). </p>
<p class ="p">6. Relative cycling rate (RCR) is a measure of the SPD's impact on the interconversion of Pr and Pfr for a given irradiance (Sager 1988). The assumed irradiance in our calculation is %s &#181;mol/ meter &#178 sec. RCR is given in Hertz (Hz). </p>
<p class ="p">7. A 1000 W HPS luminaire from P.L. Light Systems, at a 2 meter mounting height, was used for the cost analysis (Med NXT LP 1000W Beta).</p>
<p class ="p">8. A 600 W HPS luminaire from P.L. Light Systems (tested in 2013), at a 2 meter mounting height, was used for the cost analysis (PL2000 HPS 600W 240V with SON-T PIA lamp).</p>
<p class ="p">9. For the LED cost analysis, the number of LED luminaires used is based on the MH that results in the highest LSAE for a target PPFD of 300 &#181;mol/ meter &#178 sec. </p>
<p class ="p">10. The spectral power distribution (SPD) shows the absolute radiant power at each wavelength from 380 nm to 830 nm. </p>
<p class ="p">11. The ISO-PPFD contours shows the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, &#181;mol/ meter &#178 sec) isolines at fixed intervals from a single tested luminaire. The luminaire is mounted at the given mounting height (based on the maximum LSAE value) and the PPFD is calculated at 0.12 meter increments on the workplane. PPFD is analogous to lux.  </p>
<p class ="p">12. The luminaire system application efficacy (LSAE) metric is calculated by computing the PPFD at 0.12 meter increments for a range of luminaire mounting heights (MH) in a 10 m by 10 m area. Luminaires are arranged in a rectangular array within the growing area, with the luminaire quantity based on the target PPFD level. PPFD values that fall within the target average PPFD range (e.g. 100 &#181;mol/ meter &#178 sec) and an assumed average-to-minimum uniformity ratio (< 4:1)are used to compute the LSAE (&#8721 application PPF / input power from all luminaires). </p>
<p class ="p">13. The spatial color distibution image shows the color unifomity of a single tested luminaire illuminating a 3 m x 3 m work plane. It is calculated as follows. The luminaire was measured using an imaging goniophotometer, resulting in a spatial color distribution for each tristimulus value - X, Y and Z(CIE 1931 color-matching functions). The spatial color distributions were overlayed at the same mounting height (2 m) and used to illuminate a set of points on the work plane, located at 0.06 m intervals, corresponding to the XYZ values at each point. The matlab function 'xyz2rgb' was used to convert each XYZ value into an RGB value for plotting. For HID luminaires, the spatial color distribution is estimated by using the color matching values for a reference HID lamp and weighting the brightness of the value at each point by the luminous intensity distribution.</p>
<p class ="p">14. The luminous intensity distibution shows the spatial distribution using two dimensional planes (in units of candelas). The red line shows a horizontal slice through the vertical angles where the maximum candela value occurs. The blue line represents the vertical slice through the luminaire's center at the horizontal angle with the maximum candela angle. Each of the four rings in the polar diagram represents a 25%% change in luminous intensity, with the maximum candela value represented by the outer ring. Each radiating line repesents a 10 degree angular increment.</p>
